# mac-config

This is my personal storage of configurations to ease working with Mac device especially when switching between Linux and Mac plaftorms.

## Karabiner

In order to keep the same layout between platforms, I'm using Karabiner-Elements with the configuration provided in `karabiner.json`. It also overwrites a Czech layout a bit in order to be able to use same `Alt + XYZ` combinations.

## Rectangle

In order to have windows snapping support same as in Linux, allowing to snap windows to a half of the screen or even some quadrant, [Rectangle app](https://rectangleapp.com/) seems to be a perfect tool to achieve that.
